## Information about the API key
You'll notice that in the App.js for the api key I have listed 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'. Obviously, I did not want to include my own personal
api key for everyone to see, so the instructions on how to generate your own are given below.

* Firstly, go to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API website](https://dictionaryapi.com)
* Click the register button and go through the sign in process on the site
* Once you've registered the application you can go to the 'YOUR KEYS' tab to find the key. Simply copy and paste the key into the code
where I wrote 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' and your application should work correctly.
